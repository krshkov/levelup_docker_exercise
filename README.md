# LevelUp Docker Homework [DONE]

### How to Start the Project

0. **Everything in one command (3 in 1)**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:krshkov/levelup_docker_exercise.git && cd levelup_docker_exercise/ && ./start.sh

---

#### Or do it step by step:

---

1. **Clone the Git project:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:krshkov/levelup_docker_exercise.git

3. **Enter the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd levelup_docker_exercise/

---

3. **Execute the script below:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh

#### Or start it manually

3. **Copy the Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

4. **Start the application**
    ```bash
   docker compose up

### 5. That's it ðŸ˜ƒ

You can now access the project on:
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

This repository contains the homework related to the Docker classes we did this week.

Your task is simple: ensure that the application can be started by simply running `docker compose up`.

The application is a simple `node` server checking if it can connect to the database on a specific port
and writing that status as the response.

To achieve this there are four main things you will need to do:

1. write a `Dockerfile` for the main application âœ”
2. find an appropriate image on DockerHub to run MariaDB âœ”
3. connect the app with the database on the right port âœ”
4. ensure that you can access the application from the host machine. âœ”

If you did everything correctly, after navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser you should see the message:

* `Well done you have dockerized your first application!`

Other than the main 4 items mentioned above, you are free to implement the best practices
we've mentioned in the class to make working on this app a truly wonderful developer experience :)
